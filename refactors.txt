Possible future changes:
- limit reservations to 30 days at a time maximum to discourage users from making long reservations
  - include validation for date ranges to throw error if date range is over 30 days 

- change Hotel::HotelBlock to simply Hotel::Block
  - cmd + shift + F for HotelBlock and hotel_block across all files
  - change delete hotel or hotel_ (case insensitive)

Possible but improbable future changes:
- remove room and date class
  - requires rewriting the entire code
  - reduces dependencies 
  - however, will shift most of the responsibilities to system class
  - difficult to flesh out concrete ideas 
    - room class was created to allow for easier refactoring if room pricing structure changed
    - date class allows for more readable code by creating another database that acts as a calendar
      - tracking room availability can be done by iterating through all reservations & hotel blocks to look for date matches
        - if match, mark the room as unavailable
        - or if match, add the reservation to an array to be returned after iteration complete
